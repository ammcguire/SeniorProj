My view is hopefully not going to end up being a calendarview as I played for a long time with the Caldroid application in Android 
Studio however I never fully got it working as it was giving me so many errors so I am going to go a different direction with it. My progress report page implements two counters which will tell you how often you have moved an assignment, it counts down and resets every 7 days (week). Just need to fix my alerts slightly as well.


~See folder spSnaps for pics of all the pages and tasks being accomplished.~
